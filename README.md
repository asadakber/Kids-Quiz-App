# Kids quiz in Ionic 3
This application is a demo to show a little quiz using flash cards and guessing 
what vehicle is shown into the flash card.

## How to use it
The demo can be executed like any other Ionic application, using the Ionic CLI command: `ionic serve` to execute it in development mode.
The view is better in iOS devices rather than Android devices, but the usage is exactly the same.
